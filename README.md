The core components of such an application typically include:

Question Storage: A mechanism to store the quiz questions, their respective answer options, and the correct answer for each. This is often achieved using data structures like Lists or Arrays of custom Question objects.

User Interface (Input/Output): Functions to display questions and options to the user, and to capture their input (answers). In Java, this commonly involves using System.out.println() for output and java.util.Scanner for input.

Answer Validation: Logic to compare the user's provided answer against the correct answer.

Scoring System: A method to track the number of correct answers and calculate a final score for the user.

Flow Control: Loops and conditional statements to guide the user through the quiz, present questions one by one, and manage the overall quiz progression.

These applications are excellent for learning basic programming concepts such as data structures, user input/output, conditional logic, and looping constructs, all within a practical and engaging context.
